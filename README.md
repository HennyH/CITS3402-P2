# Building

Follow the instructions [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowshpc/2015/02/02/how-to-compile-and-run-a-simple-ms-mpi-program/) to install the MS-MPI SDK and executables. Ensure that after installation your `MSMPI_X` environment variables are set since the solution references these.

# Development

Install [CodeMaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SteveCadwallader.CodeMaid) and after it is installed enable formatting on save by clicking `Extensions > Code Main > Automatic Cleanup On Save ...`.
